# Tips for Contributing
1. When you are working on your local with the C++ file, you might need to update the executable after modifying your code by recompiling.
   
   For you reference, here is how I recompile with g++ command

```bash
g++ -std=c++20 DistanceCalc.cpp -o DistanceCalc.exe
```

2. To suggest changes, please feel free to use Pull Requests or directly email the owner at mluo3@hawaii.edu
