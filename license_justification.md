Since this is just a small personal toy project, I want to place the least amount of complications and restrictions on it. Therefore, the MIT license (permissive) is the best choice for it.

The project was previously under the Apache 2.0 license, but since there is no derivative work produced yet from this project, it is safe to swap to the MIT license.
